Here is a student answer that hit all the right notes. -Sanjay

Asmara has a case. The sales manager evaluated Asmara and Rodica’s performance based on their rates of converting the lead to deal each quarter. Under her criterion, Asmara had relatively lower rate than Rodica in each quarter, i.e. 0% vs. 14% in Q1 and 71% vs. 100% in Q2. (See Table1 below) But if considering the aggregate deal converting rate for two quarters, Asmara out-performed Rodica. Asmara made 5 deals out of 10 leads while Rodica 4 out of 10. Asmara made more deals than Rodica and should not be fired.

The sales manager’s evaluation criterion was unfair to Asmara because how many leads are in pipeline would influence the converting rate a lot given that converting rate equaled to deal number divided by lead number. For example, Rodica had more leads than Asmara in Q1, 7 leads and 3 leads respectively.  Rodica made 1 deal out of 7, which could not imply she was outperformed since she had a bigger lead pool. In Q2, Asmara made more deals than Rodica, 5 and 3 respectively. But because Asmara had a bigger lead pool than Rodica, 7 and 3 respectively, Asmara’s Q2 deal converting rate still lower than Rodica’s. It makes more sense to compare each one’s converting rate when the lead numbers are same for both. Therefore, aggregated converting rate for half a year is a fair criterion in this case. In two quarters, both of them had 10 leads in pipeline, Asmara made 5 deals while Rodica made 4 deals. Asmara outperformed Rodica in the half of year and should not be fired for her performance.
